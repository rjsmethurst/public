								<p>As your friendly neighborhood astrophysicist, I get overly enthusiastic about space on YouTube. I post a video once a week on my channel, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/drbecky/">Dr Becky</a>: from a recap of monthly space news, to weird objects in space, unsolved mysteries or the science history behind an idea or theory. I like to focus on <b>how</b> we know things, not just what we know. The channel has over 380,000 subscribers (and counting!), so come and join us all in the conversation. <br> <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNbYGl89UUowy8oXkipC-Q?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe</a> so you never miss a video! </b> </a></p>

Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/drbecky">YouTube channel</a> to see the astronomy and science interest videos I've made. I'm happy to discuss any astronomy, astrophysics, night sky or space exploration related news story. I also enjoy advising as an expert for scripts and books.

								I have given many public talks to a diverse range of audiences; from school groups, to astronomy societies, to festival go-ers. I also lecture on board Cunard's cruise ship fleet in conjunction with the Royal Astronomical Society. Astronomy driven tourism is one of my passions: I will travel to see the night sky! I particularly love to share that passion with others.

								<p>I get a lot of emails from subscribers with questions about the universe and becoming an astrophysicist. Before you send an email check and see if your question is answered here first. Also, if I don't respond to your email I'm very sorry - I get alot, and I don't always have the time around doing my research to answer them all.</p>

								<p id="astrophysicist"><b>I want to become an astrophysicist, can you give me some advice?</b>
								<br/>
								That's great to hear that you're as passionate about space as I am! I made a video on <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVQ3yH-Zusg">how I became an astrophysicist</a> - focussing on the path from school to my current research job. Dr Katie Mack also has a <a href="http://www.astrokatie.com/solicited-advice">fantastic page</a> with advice for aspiring astrophysicists. Essentially you should focussing on learning maths and physics at school. Outside of school you should learn to code, for example my favourite programming language is Python. There are many free courses online to learn which are also good fun. If you can, try to get involved with some research, so look if a university near you offers work experience or summer student placements. Good luck!
								</p>
								<br/>
								<p id="change"><b>I'm a [data scientist/engineer/accountant/doing a different major at college], can I still become an astrophysicist?</b>
								<br/>
								It depends what qualifications you have. To become an astrophysicist you need to do a PhD at university - this is the university degree where you do a few years of research to become an expert in the subject. The entry requirements for a PhD change from university to university, but generally you need a Master's degree in either Physics, Engineering or Mathematics (but check the web pages of those universities you're interested in doing a PhD at). If you don't have one of those you'll need to go back to do another undergraduate degree. That might not be possible for you since you're working but check out the distance learning online degrees offered by the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>. 
								</p>								
								<br/>
								<p id="workexp"><b>I want to do work experience with you! Can I?</b>
								<br/>
								Unfortunately due to university rules I’m not allowed to take people on as a work experience students individually. Instead, the Department of Physics at the Universty of Oxford run a summer school for Year 12 students to offer them a week long research experience. The details on last year’s summer school along with details on how to apply next year (once available) are <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/engage/schools/secondary-schools/summer-schools-and-work-experience">available here</a>.
								</p>								
								<br/>
								<p id="masters"><b>I'm a physics student and I want to do a research project over the summer with you! Can I? </b>
								<br/>
								The University of Oxford only allows its researchers to take on summer research students if they can be compensated for their time with a living wage. Unfortunately I don't have any funding available on my fellowship to take on summer students at the moment. However, the Astrophysics department at the University of Oxford have a centralised paid summer research program where you work with a researcher in the department for 8 weeks on a project - inlcuding me! The school typically runs from July-August and details on how to apply for that year are published in February. The details are available <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/summer-internships-undergraduates/astrophysics-summer-research-programme-2022">here</a>. 
								</p>								
								<br/>
								<p id="theory"><b>I have a theory about the Universe, will you read it?</b>
								<br/>
								No. Sorry. First of all, I'm a working researcher and keeping up with results in my own specific field takes a lot of time. Second, I'm probably not an expert in the area that you have this theory in, so I'm not the best person to read it. There's a lot that goes into becoming a professional researcher, and a lot of that is the sort of training that can tell you if an idea you have is worth pursuing or not. Especially since the majority of new theories are formed from studying the mathematics that underpins the workings of our Universe. So if you have are very passionate about physics, I can only recommend studying it at university (see above).
								</br>
								Now, unlikely as it is that someone outside academia, who hasn't dedicated years of their life to studying phsyics, will come up with a major breakthrough that will revolutionise the whole of physics; if you <i>still</i> think that you have an idea worth shouting about then you need to submit a write up of your work to a physics journal. That's how we communicate our results to the world.  
								</p>	
								</br>
								<p id="project"><b>Will you answer some questions for me for a project at school?</b>
								<br/>
								In theory, yes I will. However, there are a lot of you who email with this request, and I just don't have time for everybody. So please know, that if you email and you don't get a response: it's not you, it's me!
								</p>	
								</br>
								<p id="event"><b>Will you take part in my podcast / appear on my show / present at my event / talk at my school?</b>
								<br/>
								Sure! Check out my <a href="#media">media page</a> for more information and feel free to get in touch using the contact button below to send me the details. If I'm available I'll do all I can to help out but it all comes down to time. Balancing full time research, with YouTube, science communication and home life is always a juggling act!
								</p>	
								</br>
								<p id="married"><b>Are you married?</b>
								<br/>
								I am in a long term relationship; I have been with my partner Sam since 2007. We are incredibly happy together.
								<br/>
								</p>	
								</br>
								<p>If I've still not answered your question, then you can get in touch using the button below. However, please note that due to the volume of emails I receive I cannot respond to them all. I prioritise those with scientific or educational enquiries. I will not respond to romantic propositions; the answer is always no.</p>
